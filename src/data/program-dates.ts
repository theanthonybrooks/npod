      "What ties together flavor, care, time, and tradition? How are narratives of locality, heritage, and food culture entangled with industrial modes of flavor production? Polly Yim, founder of QU Fermentation Studio and Head of Fermentation at the vegan fine dining restaurant Oukan, will guide us through her reflections on the ways in which artisanal and industrial practices converge and inform taste in surprising ways, starting from her daily practice of small-scale experimental fermentation. We will explore the potential and limits of transferring Chinese and Japanese fermentation techniques to the German context, and taste different products brought directly from her lab.",

      "The fig trees carry many meanings across cultures, from religious symbol to everyday fruit, but beyond their familiar symbolism in Europe, figs also hold diverse identities and stories elsewhere. In this conversation, Isabel Law and Zeren Oruc explore the fig as motif in the exhibition, tracing its layered histories, overlooked varieties, and personal resonances, followed by a fig-based offering by Martin Karl Kufeita.",
